This is a test project for creating an animation system for Sprites in Unity's DOTS stack. Static animations can run around 100k sprites at 30fps.

Next Steps:
* Cut the screen into 10-16 vertical slices to help parralize sprite ordering
* Change sprite sheet data into a BlobAssetReference to reduce memory usage and searches
